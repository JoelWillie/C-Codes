# README: Overview of C# Programming Assignments (Programs 1-30)

This document provides an overview of 30 C# programming tasks completed as part of class assignments. The programs are divided into two main categories: **Procedural Programming (Pseudocode Conversions)** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Assignments**. Each program adheres to basic C# concepts covered in class, such as variables, input/output, conditionals, loops, classes, properties, inheritance, constructors, and destructors. All code is intended to be handwritten in a journal, following assignment instructions to avoid AI tools or external resources.

## Programs 1-30: Sequential Listing

Below is the complete list of all 30 programs, arranged sequentially from 1 to 30, with brief descriptions for each.

1. **Program 3**: Sums two user-input integers.  
   - Prompts the user for two integers and displays their sum.

2. **Program 2**: Sums three user-input integers.  
   - Prompts the user for three integers and displays their sum (this was noticeable similar to the first program, so just an add on).

3. **Program 3**: Calculates a shopping bill for 5 items with 16.5% GCT.  
   - Computes the total cost of 5 items, including a General Consumption Tax.

4. **Program 4**: Computes a new salary with a 15% increase.  
   - Takes a base salary and applies a 15% raise.

5. **Program 5**: Calculates a circle’s diameter, circumference, and area using pi = 3.14159.  
   - Uses a user-provided radius for calculations.

6. **Program 6**: Applies a 12% discount for items priced $10,000+.  
   - Checks item price and reduces it if above the threshold.

7. **Program 7**: Determines pass/fail status based on a test score (pass mark = 65).  
   - Evaluates a score against the pass mark.

8. **Program 8**: Computes wages with overtime (time-and-half after 40 hours) and 27% tax.  
   - Calculates net pay based on hours worked.

9. **Program 9**: Assigns a line number based on age ranges.  
   - Uses conditionals to categorize age into lines.

10. **Program 10**: Calculates examination fees based on the number of subjects.  
    - Applies a fee structure to the number of subjects entered.

11. **Program 11**: Sums and averages 10 integers using a for loop.  
    - Loops to collect and process 10 numbers.

12. **Program 12**: Finds the largest and smallest of 5 integers with a for loop.  
    - Identifies extremes from user inputs.

13. **Program 13**: Computes a bill with 2% tax for multiple items using a while loop.  
    - Loops until all items are entered, then adds tax.

14. **Program 14**: Counts odd and even integers with a do-while loop.  
    - Classifies numbers until a sentinel value is entered.

15. **Program 15**: Calculates a bill for 15 items with 20% discount and 16.5% GCT using a for loop.  
    - Applies discount and tax to a fixed number of items.

16. **Program 16**: Averages math scores for 40 students with a for loop.  
    - Computes the mean of student scores.

17. **Program 17**: Finds the oldest age among 200 relatives using a for loop.  
    - Tracks the maximum age across inputs.

18. **Program 18**: Totals gas pump sales with a do-while loop.  
    - Accumulates sales until stopped by the user.

19. **Program 19**: Averages monthly electricity bills over 36 months with a for loop.  
    - Calculates the mean bill over three years.

20. **Program 20**: Identifies the most expensive item in a store using a do-while loop.  
    - Finds the highest price among entered items.

21. **Program 21: Circle Class for Area and Diameter**  
    - **Purpose**: Calculates and prints the area and diameter of a circle given its radius.  
    - **Features**: Includes constructors, a destructor, and methods for calculations; handles two circle objects with user input.

22. **Program 22: OOP Calculator**  
    - **Purpose**: Performs arithmetic operations based on a user-selected code.  
    - **Features**: Uses a `Calculator` class with a menu for operation selection; handles errors like division by zero.

23. **Program 23: [Class Example]**  
    - **Note**: Details were provided in class.

24. **Program 24: [Class Example]**  
    - **Note**: Details were provided in class.

25. **Program 25: Rectangle Class**  
    - **Purpose**: Manages rectangle dimensions and calculates area and perimeter.  
    - **Features**: Includes fields, properties, and methods for input and display; uses constructors.

26. **Program 26: Quiz Competition**  
    - **Purpose**: Creates a quiz for two grade 9 students with 5 science questions.  
    - **Features**: Uses `Question` and `Quiz` classes; tracks scores and determines a winner.

27. **Program 27: Student Class**  
    - **Purpose**: Manages student data (ID, name, grades) and calculates averages.  
    - **Features**: Includes constructors, a destructor, and methods for user input and display.

28. **Program 28: Circle Class**  
    - **Purpose**: Calculates a circle’s diameter and area based on radius.  
    - **Features**: Enhanced with user input for radius; includes constructors and a destructor.

29. **Program 29: Car Class with Inheritance**  
    - **Purpose**: Extends `Automobile` to include a `doors` property and data methods.  
    - **Features**: Demonstrates inheritance and user interaction.

30. **Program 30: TableTop Class with Inheritance**  
    - **Purpose**: Calculates tabletop cost using dimensions and unit cost, inheriting from `Rectangle`.  
    - **Features**: Uses inheritance and methods for cost computation.

## General Notes
- **Environment**: All programs are console applications written in C#.
- **Syntax**: Uses basic constructs like `Console.WriteLine`, `Console.ReadLine`, `int.Parse`, `double.Parse`, if-statements, loops, classes, properties, and inheritance.
- **Handwriting**: All code must be handwritten in a journal per assignment rules.
